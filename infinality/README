These fontconfig configuration files are intended to be used in 
conjunction with the freetype-infinality subpixel hinting patch at:

  http://www.infinality.net/

Windows, OSX, Google, and Linux fonts are included in the rules
along with other misc popular or useful fonts found on the web.

Feel free to propose additions and changes to this file at:

HOW TO USE THIS CONFIGURATION
=============================

1) Unzip fontconfig-infinality into /etc/fonts/.
2) Ensure /etc/fonts/conf.d/ contains a symlink 52-infinality.conf which points to /etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf
3) Adjust various settings in /etc/fonts/infinality/infinality.conf to personal taste.
4) Change rendering style with the symlink /etc/fonts/infinality/conf.d to personal taste.

/etc/fonts/local.conf should either not exist, or have no infinality-related configurations in it.
