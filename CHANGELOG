	/********************************************************************

	Add a strong binding for Cantarell to fix display problems.
	Add all Windows 7 fonts into the TT instructed list for mega-improvement
	  on non-latin fonts!  Why didn't I do this before?


	/********************************************************************
	Changes for 2011-11-20
	/********************************************************************

	Remove the Canwell replacement.
	Rearrange the order of variables near the top of this file.


	/********************************************************************
	Changes for 2011-11-17
	/********************************************************************

	Added these to TT list:
		Arimo
		Cousine
		Tinos
		Ubuntu

	Added variables near the top that allow you to adjust settings and replacements very easily (see below)
	Finished out the OS styles named "OSX" (formerly Apple) and "Linux".
	Added settings to either enable or disable your own global replacements
	Added settings to enable or disable bitmap fonts (this still has issues-  please help)
	Added config option to force replacements of similar fontsets
	Removed matrix settings for Verdana / Dejavu Sans.  Now built into Infinality patch
	Helvetica Neue and Courier New are not replaced on OS styles besides "Infinality".
	Don't create an artificial bold face for really light or thick fonts.
	NOTE: Assistance with replacments and default fonts for various OS styles is welcomed!


	/********************************************************************
	Changes for 2010-11-14
	/********************************************************************

	Added configuration for different rendering styles. These can be enabled by
	  uncommenting the style you want.  For instance, if you want your system
	  to look like Windows 98, uncomment that style, and make sure others
	  are commented out.  Obviously you'd want to have appropriate fonts
	  installed for that rendering style.  Aliases for different OS
	  fontsets will be added eventually.  The old default style is now
	  considered "Infinality" style.  Not all styles that are defined are
	  filled in yet- but "Apple" and anything above it are.

	Due to the above, in combination with the prevalence of @font-face on
	  the web, I've made "Infinality" style rendering use autohint by
	  default, and only call out fonts that specifically should use TT
	  hinting.  The patched autohint will render more fonts, better, than
	  TT native hinting will.


	/********************************************************************
	Changes for 2010-10-22
	/********************************************************************

	Promoted Century Gothic, Arial Black and Calibri to Full TT subpixel hinting
	Added Google fonts
	Added Nimbus fonts
	Added more Apple fonts
	Replace Courier New with Apple's Courier - MUCH nicer result
	Better comments to help new users understand what everything means
	Reorganization of some rules
	General Cleanup
	Removed code for artificial oblique, as most distros have this in
	  /etc/fonts/conf.d/
	Added nonlatin font alias preferences that favor MS fonts, which have the
	  best hinting AFAICT. If you have all Windows Vista/7 fonts installed,
	  www.wikipedia.org should look pretty nice.

	/********************************************************************
	Changes for 2010-10-03
	/********************************************************************

	Promoted Geneva, Geneva CY to Full TT subpixel hinting.
	Added an alias for "Trebuchet" to point to "Trebuchet MS"
